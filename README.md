# 🧘 Zen Language

Zen is a modern systems programming language built for clarity, performance, and control. It’s designed to empower developers with low-level capabilities while maintaining a clean, expressive syntax. Zen is multi-paradigm, blending functional pipelines, object-style methods, and data-oriented layouts—all without the legacy baggage.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

Zen was born out of a desire to rethink systems programming from the ground up. Instead of retrofitting safety and expressiveness into decades-old languages, Zen starts fresh:

- ✅ **Simplicity**: Minimal syntax, no hidden magic.
- ⚡ **Performance**: Deterministic memory model, zero-cost abstractions.
- 🔒 **Safety**: Explicit ownership, no garbage collector, predictable concurrency.
- 🧩 **Interoperability**: Seamless FFI with C and other native libraries.

Whether you're building compilers, operating systems, or high-performance applications, Zen gives you the tools to do it with confidence and elegance.

## 🤝 Why Contribute

Zen is more than a language—it's a growing community of developers who believe in thoughtful design and fearless engineering. By contributing, you’ll:

- Help shape a language that prioritizes developer experience and system integrity.
- Gain experience in compiler design, language tooling, and runtime architecture.
- Collaborate with passionate engineers and language enthusiasts.
- Leave your mark on a project that dares to challenge the status quo.

We welcome contributions of all kinds: code, documentation, examples, tooling, and ideas. If you’re curious, creative, or just want to learn—there’s a place for you here.

## 👤 About the Developer

Hi, I’m the creator of Zen—a systems programmer with a love for clean abstractions and expressive code. I started this project to explore what a modern low-level language could look like if it were designed today, not 40 years ago. I believe in open collaboration, clear communication, and building tools that make developers feel powerful.

If you’re interested in contributing, collaborating, or just chatting about language design, feel free to reach out or open an issue. I’d love to hear from you.

## 📦 Getting Started

Zen is still in early development, but you can try it out by cloning the repo and running the compiler:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oliviermugishak/zen-lang
cd zen-lang
make run
```

Check out the [`spec.md`](./spec.md) for a full language overview.
